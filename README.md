# Samples

This demo is a proof-of-concept for a simple electronic sample controller using Web Audio API.

Users can click on one of the 15 samples to play them or use the keyboard (qwerty-asdfg-zxcvb).

New samples can be set by dragging mp3 ([or other supported audio formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats)) on to the samples or long-pressing for file input.

There is no persistent storage - all samples are played back in memory.
